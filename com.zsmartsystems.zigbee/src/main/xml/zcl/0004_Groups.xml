    <name>Groups</name>
    <description>The ZigBee specification provides the capability for group addressing. That is, any endpoint on any device may be assigned to one or more groups, each labeled with a 16-bit identifier (0x0001 &#8211; 0xfff7), which acts for all intents and purposes like a network address. Once a group is established, frames, sent using the APSDE-DATA.request primitive and having a DstAddrMode of 0x01, denoting group addressing, will be delivered to every endpoint assigned to the group address named in the DstAddr parameter of the outgoing APSDE-DATA.request primitive on every device in the network for which there are such endpoints.</description>
    <description>Management of group membership on each device and endpoint is implemented by the APS, but the over-the-air messages that allow for remote management and commissioning of groups are defined here in the cluster library on the theory that, while the basic group addressing facilities are integral to the operation of the stack, not every device will need or want to implement this management cluster. Furthermore, the placement of the management commands here allows developers of proprietary profiles to avoid implementing the library cluster but still exploit group addressing</description>
    <description>In order to ensure that only authorized devices are able to set up groups (particularly if application link keys are to be used) the following approach SHOULD be employed. The security Permissions Configuration Table provides a mechanism by which certain commands can be restricted to specified authorized devices. Configuration of groups via the Groups cluster SHOULD use the ApplicationSettings permissions entry of this table to specify from which devices group configuration commands MAY be received, and whether a link key is required.</description>
