/**
 * Simple Descriptor Store value object class.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Simple_desc_store_req is provided to enable ZigBee end devices on the network to
 * request storage of their list of Simple Descriptors on a Primary Discovery Cache device
 * which has previously received a SUCCESS status from a Discovery_store_req to the same
 * Primary Discovery Cache device. Note that each Simple Descriptor for every active endpoint
 * on the Local Device must be individually uploaded to the Primary Discovery Cache device via
 * this command to enable cached discovery. Included in this request is the length of the Simple
 * Descriptor the Local Device wishes to cache and the Simple Descriptor itself. The endpoint
 * is a field within the Simple Descriptor and is accessed by the Remote Device to manage the
 * discovery cache information for the Local Device.
