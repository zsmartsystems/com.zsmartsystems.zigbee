 * binding table cache and contains the status of the request. This command shall be
 * unicast to the requesting device. If the remote device is not a backup binding table
 * cache, it shall return a status of NOT_SUPPORTED. If the originator of the
 * request is not recognized as a primary binding table cache, it shall return a status
 * of INV_REQUESTTYPE. Otherwise, the backup binding table cache shall delete
 * the binding entry from its binding table and return a status of SUCCESS. If the
 * entry is not found, it shall return a status of NO_ENTRY.
