/**
 * Extended Active Endpoint Request value object class.
 * <p>
 * The Extended_Active_EP_req command is generated from a local device wishing
 * to acquire the list of endpoints on a remote device with simple descriptors. This
 * command shall be unicast either to the remote device itself or to an alternative
 * device that contains the discovery information of the remote device. The
 * Extended_Active_EP_req is used for devices which support more active
 * endpoints than can be returned by a single Active_EP_req.
 * <br>
 * The NWKAddrOfInterest field shall contain the network address of the remote device for
 * which the active endpoint list is required. The StartIndex field shall be set in the
 * request to enable retrieval of lists of active endpoints from devices whose list exceeds
 * the size of a single ASDU and where fragmentation is not supported.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
