/**
 * Extended Active Endpoint Request value object class.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Extended_Active_EP_req command is generated from a local device wishing to acquire the
 * list of endpoints on a remote device with simple descriptors. This command shall be unicast
 * either to the remote device itself or to an alternative device that contains the discovery
 * information of the remote device. The Extended_Active_EP_req is used for devices which
 * support more active endpoints than can be returned by a single Active_EP_req. <br> The
 * NWKAddrOfInterest field shall contain the network address of the remote device for which
 * the active endpoint list is required. The StartIndex field shall be set in the request to
 * enable retrieval of lists of active endpoints from devices whose list exceeds the size of a
 * single ASDU and where fragmentation is not supported.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
