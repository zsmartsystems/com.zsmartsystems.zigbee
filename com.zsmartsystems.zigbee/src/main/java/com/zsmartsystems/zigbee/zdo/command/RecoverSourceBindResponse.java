/**
 * Recover Source Bind Response value object class.
 * <p>
 * The Recover_Source_Bind_rsp is generated from a backup binding table cache
 * device in response to a Recover_Source_Bind_req from a primary binding table
 * cache and contains the status of the request. This command shall be unicast to the
 * requesting device. If the responding device is not a backup binding table cache, it
 * shall return a status of NOT_SUPPORTED. If the originator of the request is not
 * recognized as a primary binding table cache, it shall return a status of
 * INV_REQUESTTYPE. Otherwise, the backup binding table cache shall prepare a
 * list of binding table entries from its backup beginning with StartIndex. It will fit in
 * as many entries as possible into a Recover_Source_Bind_rsp command and return
 * a status of SUCCESS. If StartIndex is more than the number of entries in the
 * Source table, a status of NO_ENTRY is returned. For a successful response,
 * SourceTableEntries is the total number of entries in the backup source table, and
 * SourceTableListCount is the number of entries which is being returned in the
 * response.

 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
