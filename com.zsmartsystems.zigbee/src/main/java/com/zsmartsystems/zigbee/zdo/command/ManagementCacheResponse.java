/**
 * Management Cache Response value object class.
 * <p>
 * The Mgmt_Cache_rsp is generated in response to an Mgmt_Cache_req. If this
 * management command is not supported, or the Remote Device is not a Primary
 * Cache Device, a status of NOT_SUPPORTED shall be returned and all parameter
 * fields after the Status field shall be omitted. Otherwise, the Remote Device shall
 * implement the following processing. Upon receipt of the Mgmt_Cache_req and
 * after support for the Mgmt_Cache_req has been verified, the Remote Device shall
 * access an internally maintained list of registered ZigBee End Devices utilizing the
 * discovery cache on this Primary Discovery Cache device. The entries reported
 * shall be those, starting with StartIndex and including whole DiscoveryCacheList
 * records until the limit on MSDU size, i.e., aMaxMACFrameSize, is reached. Within
 * the Mgmt_Cache_rsp command, the
 * DiscoveryCacheListEntries field shall represent the total number of registered
 * entries in the Remote Device. The parameter DiscoveryCacheListCount shall be
 * the number of entries reported in the DiscoveryCacheList field of the
 * Mgmt_Cache_rsp command.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
