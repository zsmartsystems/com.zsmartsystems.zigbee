/**
 * Management Network Discovery Response value object class.
 * <p>
 * The Mgmt_NWK_Disc_rsp is generated in response to an
 * Mgmt_NWK_Disc_req. If this management command is not supported, a status
 * of NOT_SUPPORTED shall be returned and all parameter fields after the Status
 * field shall be omitted. Otherwise, the Remote Device shall implement the
 * following process.
 * <br>
 * Upon receipt of and after support for the Mgmt_NWK_Disc_req has been
 * verified, the Remote Device shall issue an NLME-NETWORKDISCOVERY.request
 * primitive using the ScanChannels and ScanDuration
 * parameters, supplied in the Mgmt_NWK_Disc_req command. Upon receipt of the
 * NLME-NETWORK-DISCOVERY.confirm primitive, the Remote Device shall
 * report the results, starting with the StartIndex element, via the
 * Mgmt_NWK_Disc_rsp command. The NetworkList field shall contain whole
 * NetworkList records, until the limit on
 * MSDU size, i.e., aMaxMACFrameSize, is reached. The number of
 * results reported shall be set in the NetworkListCount.
