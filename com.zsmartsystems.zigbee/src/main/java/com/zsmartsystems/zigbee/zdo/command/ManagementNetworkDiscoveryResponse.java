/**
 * Management Network Discovery Response value object class.

 * The Mgmt_NWK_Disc_rsp is generated in response to an Mgmt_NWK_Disc_req. If this
 * management command is not supported, a status of NOT_SUPPORTED shall be returned and all
 * parameter fields after the Status field shall be omitted. Otherwise, the Remote Device
 * shall implement the following process. <br> Upon receipt of and after support for the
 * Mgmt_NWK_Disc_req has been verified, the Remote Device shall issue an
 * NLME-NETWORKDISCOVERY.request primitive using the ScanChannels and ScanDuration
 * parameters, supplied in the Mgmt_NWK_Disc_req command. Upon receipt of the
 * NLME-NETWORK-DISCOVERY.confirm primitive, the Remote Device shall report the results,
 * starting with the StartIndex element, via the Mgmt_NWK_Disc_rsp command. The NetworkList
 * field shall contain whole NetworkList records, until the limit on MSDU size, i.e.,
 * aMaxMACFrameSize, is reached. The number of results reported shall be set in the
 * NetworkListCount.
