/**
 * Replace Device Request value object class.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Replace_Device_req is intended for use by a special device such as a Commissioning tool
 * and is sent to a primary binding table cache device to change all binding table entries which
 * match OldAddress and OldEndpoint as specified. Note that OldEndpoint = 0 has special
 * meaning and signifies that only the address needs to be matched. The endpoint in the binding
 * table will not be changed in this case and so NewEndpoint is ignored. The processing changes
 * all binding table entries for which the source address is the same as OldAddress and, if
 * OldEndpoint is non-zero, for which the source endpoint is the same as OldEndpoint. It shall
 * also change all binding table entries which have the destination address the same as
 * OldAddress and, if OldEndpoint is non-zero, the destination endpoint the same as
 * OldEndpoint. The destination addressing mode for this request is unicast.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
