/**
 * Replace Device Request value object class.
 * <p>
 * The Replace_Device_req is intended for use by a special device such as a
 * Commissioning tool and is sent to a primary binding table cache device to change
 * all binding table entries which match OldAddress and OldEndpoint as specified.
 * Note that OldEndpoint = 0 has special meaning and signifies that only the address
 * needs to be matched. The endpoint in the binding table will not be changed in this
 * case and so NewEndpoint is ignored. The processing changes all binding table
 * entries for which the source address is the same as OldAddress and, if
 * OldEndpoint is non-zero, for which the source endpoint is the same as
 * OldEndpoint. It shall also change all binding table entries which have the
 * destination address the same as OldAddress and, if OldEndpoint is non-zero, the
 * destination endpoint the same as OldEndpoint. The destination addressing mode
 * for this request is unicast.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
