/**
 * Recover Bind Table Response value object class.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Recover_Bind_Table_rsp is generated from a backup binding table cache device in
 * response to a Recover_Bind_Table_req from a primary binding table cache and contains the
 * status of the request. This command shall be unicast to the requesting device. If the
 * responding device is not a backup binding table cache, it shall return a status of
 * NOT_SUPPORTED. If the originator of the request is not recognized as a primary binding table
 * cache it shall return a status of INV_REQUESTTYPE. Otherwise, the backup binding table
 * cache shall prepare a list of binding table entries from its backup beginning with
 * StartIndex. It will fit in as many entries as possible into a Recover_Bind_Table_rsp
 * command and return a status of SUCCESS. If StartIndex is more than the number of entries in the
 * Binding table, a status of NO_ENTRY is returned. For a successful response,
 * BindingTableEntries is the total number of entries in the backup binding table, and
 * BindingTableListCount is the number of entries which is being returned in the response.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
