/**
 * Find Node Cache Request value object class.
 * <p>
 * The Find_node_cache_req is provided to enable ZigBee devices on the network to
 * broadcast to all devices for which macRxOnWhenIdle = TRUE a request to find a
 * device on the network that holds discovery information for the device of interest,
 * as specified in the request parameters. The effect of a successful
 * Find_node_cache_req is to have the Primary Discovery Cache device, holding
 * discovery information for the device of interest, unicast a Find_node_cache_rsp
 * back to the Local Device. Note that, like the NWK_addr_req, only the device
 * meeting this criteria shall respond to the request generated by
 * Find_node_cache_req.
