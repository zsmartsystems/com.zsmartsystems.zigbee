/**
 * Find Node Cache Request value object class.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Find_node_cache_req is provided to enable ZigBee devices on the network to broadcast to
 * all devices for which macRxOnWhenIdle = TRUE a request to find a device on the network that
 * holds discovery information for the device of interest, as specified in the request
 * parameters. The effect of a successful Find_node_cache_req is to have the Primary
 * Discovery Cache device, holding discovery information for the device of interest, unicast
 * a Find_node_cache_rsp back to the Local Device. Note that, like the NWK_addr_req, only the
 * device meeting this criteria shall respond to the request generated by
 * Find_node_cache_req.
