/**
 * <b>Ota Upgrade</b> cluster implementation (<i>Cluster ID 0x0019</i>).
 * <p>
 * The cluster provides a standard way to upgrade devices in the network via OTA messages. Thus
 * the upgrade process may be performed between two devices from different manufacturers.
 * Devices are required to have application bootloader and additional memory space in order to
 * successfully implement the cluster.
 * <p>
 * It is the responsibility of the server to indicate to the clients when update images are
 * available. The client may be upgraded or downgraded64. The upgrade server knows which
 * client devices to upgrade and to what file version. The upgrade server may be notified of such
 * information via the backend system. For ZR clients, the server may send a message to notify
 * the device when an updated image is available. It is assumed that ZED clients will not be awake
 * to receive an unsolicited notification of an available image. All clients (ZR and ZED) shall
 * query (poll) the server periodically to determine whether the server has an image update for
 * them. Image Notify is optional.
 * <p>
 * The cluster is implemented in such a way that the client service works on both ZED and ZR
 * devices. Being able to handle polling is mandatory for all server devices while being able to
 * send a notify is optional. Hence, all client devices must be able to use a ‘poll’ mechanism to
 * send query message to the server in order to see if the server has any new file for it. The
 * polling mechanism also puts fewer resources on the upgrade server. It is ideal to have the
 * server maintain as little state as possible since this will scale when there are hundreds of
 * clients in the network. The upgrade server is not required to keep track of what pieces of an
 * image that a particular client has received; instead the client shall do that. Lastly poll
 * makes more sense for devices that may need to perform special setup to get ready to receive an
 * image, such as unlocking flash or allocating space for the new image.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
