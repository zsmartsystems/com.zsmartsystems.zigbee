/**
 * <b>Key Establishment</b> cluster implementation (<i>Cluster ID 0x0800</i>).
 * <p>
 * This cluster provides attributes and commands to perform mutual authentication and
 * establish keys between two ZigBee devices.
 * <p>
 * All Key Establishment messages should be sent with APS retries enabled. A failure to receive
 * an ACK in a timely manner can be seen as a failure of key establishment. No Terminate Key
 * Establishment should be sent to the partner of device that has timed out the operation.
 * <p>
 * The initiator can initiate the key establishment with any active endpoint on the responder
 * device that supports the key establishment cluster. The endpoint can be either
 * preconfigured or discovered, for example, by using ZDO Match_Desc_req. A link key
 * successfully established using key establishment is valid for all endpoints on a
 * particular device. The responder shall respond to the initiator using the source endpoint
 * of the initiator's messages as the destination endpoint of the responder's messages.
 * <p>
 * It is expected that the time it takes to perform the various cryptographic computations of
 * the key establishment cluster may vary greatly based on the device. Therefore rather than
 * set static timeouts, the Initiate Key Establishment Request and Response messages will
 * contain approximate values for how long the device will take to generate the ephemeral data
 * and how long the device will take to generate confirm key message. A device performing key
 * establishment can use this information in order to choose a reasonable timeout for its
 * partner during those operations. The timeout should also take into consideration the time
 * it takes for a message to traverse the network including APS retries. A minimum transmission
 * time of 2 seconds is recommended.
 * <p>
 * For the Initiate Key Establishment Response message, it is recommended the initiator wait
 * at least 2 seconds before timing out the operation. It is not expected that generating an
 * Initiate Key Establishment Response will take significant time compared to generating the
 * Ephemeral Data and Confirm Key messages.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
