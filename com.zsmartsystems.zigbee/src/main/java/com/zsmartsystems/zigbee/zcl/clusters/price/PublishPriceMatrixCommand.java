/**
 * Publish Price Matrix Command value object class.
 * <p>
 * Cluster: <b>Price</b>. Command ID 0x05 is sent <b>FROM</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Price cluster.
 * <p>
 * The PublishPriceMatrix command is used to publish the Block Price Information Set (up to 15
 * tiers x 15 blocks) and the Extended Price Information Set (up to 48 tiers). The
 * PublishPriceMatrix command is sent in response to a GetPriceMatrix command. Clients
 * should be capable of storing at least two instances of the Price Matrix, the currently active
 * and the next one. There may be a separate Price Matrix for consumption delivered and
 * received; in this case, each Price Matrix will be identified by a different IssuerTariffId
 * value. The Price server shall send only the number of tiers and blocks as defined in the
 * corresponding PublishTariffInformation command (NumberofPriceTiersinUse,
 * NumberofBlockThresholdsinUse+1) <br> The maximum application payload may not be
 * sufficient to transfer all Price Matrix elements in one command. Therefore the ESI may send
 * as many PublishPriceMatrix commands as needed. In this case the first command shall have
 * CommandIndex set to 0, the second to 1 and so on; all associated commands shall use the same
 * value of Issuer Event ID. Note that, in this case, it is the client’s responsibility to ensure
 * that it receives all associated PublishPriceMatrix commands before any of the payloads can
 * be used.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
