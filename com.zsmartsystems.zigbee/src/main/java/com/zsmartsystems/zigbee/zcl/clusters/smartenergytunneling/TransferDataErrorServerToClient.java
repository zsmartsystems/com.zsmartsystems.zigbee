/**
 * Transfer Data Error Server To Client value object class.
 * <p>
 * Cluster: <b>Smart Energy Tunneling</b>. Command ID 0x02 is sent <b>FROM</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Smart Energy Tunneling cluster.
 * <p>
 * This command is generated by the receiver of a TransferData command if the tunnel status
 * indicates that something is wrong. There are two three cases in which TransferDataError is
 * sent:
 * <p>
 * The TransferData received contains a TunnelID that does not match to any of the active
 * tunnels of the receiving device. This could happen if a (sleeping) device sends a
 * TransferData command to a tunnel that has been closed by the server after the
 * CloseTunnelTimeout.
 * <p>
 * The TransferData received contains a proper TunnelID of an active tunnel, but the device
 * sending the data does not match to it.
 * <p>
 * The TransferData received contains more data than indicated by the
 * MaximumIncomingTransferSize of the receiving device.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
