 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Price cluster.
 * <p>
 * The PublishCPPEvent command is sent from an ESI to its Price clients to notify them of a
 * Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) event. <br> When the PublishCPPEvent command is received, the
 * IHD or Meter shall act in one of two ways: 1. It shall notify the consumer that there is a CPP
 * event that requires acknowledgment. The acknowledgement shall be either to accept the
 * CPPEvent or reject the CPPEvent (in which case it shall send the CPPEventResponse command,
 * with the CPPAuth parameter set to Accepted or Rejected). It is recommended that the CPP event
 * is ignored until a consumer either accepts or rejects the event. 2. The CPPAuth parameter is
 * set to “Forced”, in which case the CPPEvent has been accepted.
