/**
 * Check In Response value object class.

 * Cluster: <b>Poll Control</b>. Command ID 0x00 is sent <b>TO</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Poll Control cluster.
 * <p>
 * The Check-in Response is sent in response to the receipt of a Check-in command. The Check-in
 * Response is used by the Poll Control Client to indicate whether it would like the device
 * implementing the Poll Control Cluster Server to go into a fast poll mode and for how long. If
 * the Poll Control Cluster Client indicates that it would like the device to go into a fast poll
 * mode, it is responsible for telling the device to stop fast polling when it is done sending
 * messages to the fast polling device. <br> If the Poll Control Server receives a Check-In
 * Response from a client for which there is no binding (unbound), it should respond with a
 * Default Response with a status value indicating ACTION_DENIED. <br> If the Poll Control
 * Server receives a Check-In Response from a client for which there is a binding (bound) with an
 * invalid fast poll interval it should respond with a Default Response with status
 * INVALID_VALUE. <br> If the Poll Control Server receives a Check-In Response from a bound
 * client after temporary fast poll mode is completed it should respond with a Default Response
 * with a status value indicating TIMEOUT. <br> In all of the above cases, the Server shall
 * respond with a Default Response not equal to ZCL_SUCCESS.
