/**
 * Get Alarm Command value object class.

 * Cluster: <b>Alarms</b>. Command is sent <b>TO</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Alarms cluster.
 * <p>
 * Attributes and commands for sending alarm notifications and configuring alarm
 * functionality.
 * <p>
 * Alarm conditions and their respective alarm codes are described in individual
 * clusters, along with an alarm mask field. Where not masked, alarm notifications
 * are reported to subscribed targets using binding.
 * <p>
 * Where an alarm table is implemented, all alarms, masked or otherwise, are
 * recorded and may be retrieved on demand.
 * <p>
 * Alarms may either reset automatically when the conditions that cause are no
 * longer active, or may need to be explicitly reset.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
