/**
 * Initiate Test Mode Command value object class.
 * <p>
 * Cluster: <b>IAS Zone</b>. Command ID 0x02 is sent <b>TO</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the IAS Zone cluster.
 * <p>
 * Certain IAS Zone servers may have operational configurations that could be configured OTA
 * or locally on the device. This command enables them to be remotely placed into a test mode so
 * that the user or installer may configure their field of view, sensitivity, and other
 * operational parameters. They may also verify the placement and proper operation of the IAS
 * Zone server, which may have been placed in a difficult to reach location (i.e., making a
 * physical input on the device impractical to trigger). <br> Another use case for this command
 * is large deployments, especially commercial and industrial, where placing the entire IAS
 * system into test mode instead of a single IAS Zone server is infeasible due to the
 * vulnerabilities that might arise. This command enables only a single IAS Zone server to be
 * placed into test mode. <br> The biggest limitation of this command is that most IAS Zone
 * servers today are battery-powered sleepy nodes that cannot reliably receive commands.
 * However, implementers may decide to program an IAS Zone server by factory default to
 * maintain a limited duration of normal polling upon initialization/joining to a new
 * network. Some IAS Zone servers may also have AC mains power and are able to receive commands.
 * Some types of IAS Zone servers that may benefit from this command are: motion sensors and fire
 * sensor/smoke alarm listeners (i.e., a device that listens for a non-communicating fire
 * sensor to alarm and communicates this to the IAS CIE).
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
