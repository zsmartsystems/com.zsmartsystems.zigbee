 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Price cluster.
 * <p>
 * The PublishBlockThresholds command is sent in response to a GetBlockThresholds command.
 * Clients should be capable of storing at least two instances of the Block Thresholds, the
 * currently active and the next one. <br> There may be a separate set of Block Thresholds for
 * consumption delivered and received; in this case, each set of Block Thresholds will be
 * identified by a different IssuerTariffId value. <br> The price server shall send only the
 * number of block thresholds in use (NumberofBlockThresholdsInUse) as defined in the
 * PublishTariffInformation command. <br> The maximum application payload may not be
 * sufficient to transfer all thresholds in one command. In this case the Price server may send
 * two consecutive PublishBlockThreshold commands (CommandIndex set to 0 and 1
 * respectively); both commands shall use the same value of Issuer Event ID. Note that, in this
 * case, it is the client’s responsibility to ensure that it receives all associated
 * PublishBlockThreshold commands before any of the payloads can be used.
