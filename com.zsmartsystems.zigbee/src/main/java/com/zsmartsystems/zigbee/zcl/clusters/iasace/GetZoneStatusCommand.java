/**
 * Get Zone Status Command value object class.
 * <p>
 * Cluster: <b>IAS ACE</b>. Command ID 0x09 is sent <b>TO</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the IAS ACE cluster.
 * <p>
 * This command is used by ACE clients to request an update of the status of the IAS Zone devices
 * managed by the ACE server (i.e., the IAS CIE). In particular, this command is useful for
 * battery-powered ACE clients with polling rates longer than the ZigBee standard check-in
 * rate. The command is similar to the Get Attributes Supported command in that it specifies a
 * starting Zone ID and a number of Zone IDs for which information is requested. Depending on the
 * number of IAS Zone devices managed by the IAS ACE server, sending the Zone Status of all zones
 * may not fit into a single Get ZoneStatus Response command. IAS ACE clients may need to send
 * multiple Get Zone Status commands in order to get the information they seek.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
