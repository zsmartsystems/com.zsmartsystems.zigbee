/**
 * Get Relay Status Log value object class.
 * <p>
 * The Get Relay Status Log command is used to query the thermostat internal relay status log. This command has no payload.
 * <br>
 * The log storing order is First in First Out (FIFO) when the log is generated and stored into the Queue.
 * <br>
 * The first record in the log (i.e., the oldest) one, is the first to be replaced when there is a new record and there is
 * no more space in the log. Thus, the newest record will overwrite the oldest one if there is no space left.
 * <br>
 * The log storing order is Last In First Out (LIFO) when the log is being retrieved from the Queue by a client device.
 * Once the "Get Relay Status Log Response" frame is sent by the Server, the "Unread Entries" attribute
 * SHOULD be decremented to indicate the number of unread records that remain in the queue.
 * <br>
 * If the "Unread Entries"attribute reaches zero and the Client sends a new "Get Relay Status Log Request", the Server
 * MAY send one of the following items as a response:
 * <br>
 * i) resend the last Get Relay Status Log Response
 * or
 * ii) generate new log record at the time of request and send Get Relay Status Log Response with the new data
 * <p>
 * Cluster: <b>Thermostat</b>. Command is sent <b>TO</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Thermostat cluster.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
