/**
 * Get Relay Status Log value object class.
 * <p>
 * Cluster: <b>Thermostat</b>. Command ID 0x04 is sent <b>TO</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Thermostat cluster.
 * <p>
 * The Get Relay Status Log command is used to query the thermostat internal relay status log.
 * This command has no payload. <br> The log storing order is First in First Out (FIFO) when the
 * log is generated and stored into the Queue. <br> The first record in the log (i.e., the oldest)
 * one, is the first to be replaced when there is a new record and there is no more space in the log.
 * Thus, the newest record will overwrite the oldest one if there is no space left. <br> The log
 * storing order is Last In First Out (LIFO) when the log is being retrieved from the Queue by a
 * client device. Once the "Get Relay Status Log Response" frame is sent by the Server, the
 * "Unread Entries" attribute should be decremented to indicate the number of unread records
 * that remain in the queue. <br> If the "Unread Entries"attribute reaches zero and the Client
 * sends a new "Get Relay Status Log Request", the Server may send one of the following items as a
 * response: <br> i) resend the last Get Relay Status Log Response or ii) generate new log record
 * at the time of request and send Get Relay Status Log Response with the new data
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
