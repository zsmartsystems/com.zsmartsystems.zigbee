/**
 * <b>Level Control</b> cluster implementation (<i>Cluster ID 0x0008</i>).
 * <p>
 * This cluster provides an interface for controlling a characteristic of a device that can be
 * set to a level, for example the brightness of a light, the degree of closure of a door, or the
 * power output of a heater.
 * <p>
 * For many applications, a close relationship between this cluster and the OnOff cluster is
 * needed. This section describes the dependencies that are required when an endpoint that
 * implements the Level Control server cluster also implements the On/Off server cluster.
 * <p>
 * The OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster and the CurrentLevel attribute of the Level
 * Control cluster are intrinsically independent variables, as they are on different
 * clusters. However, when both clusters are implemented on the same endpoint, dependencies
 * may be introduced between them. Facilities are provided to introduce dependencies if
 * required.
 * <p>
 * There are two sets of commands provided in the Level Control cluster. These are identical,
 * except that the first set (Move to Level, Move and Step) shall NOT affect the OnOff attribute,
 * whereas the second set ('with On/Off' variants) SHALL.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
