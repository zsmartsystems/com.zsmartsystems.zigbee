/**
 * <b>Poll Control</b> cluster implementation (<i>Cluster ID 0x0020</i>).
 * <p>
 * This cluster provides a mechanism for the management of an end device’s MAC Data Request
 * rate. For the purposes of this cluster, the term “poll” always refers to the sending of a MAC
 * Data Request from the end device to the end device’s parent. This cluster can be used for
 * instance by a configuration device to make an end device responsive for a certain period of
 * time so that the device can be managed by the controller. This cluster is composed of a client
 * and server. The end device implements the server side of this cluster. The server side
 * contains several attributes related to the MAC Data Request rate for the device. The client
 * side implements commands used to manage the poll rate for the device. The end device which
 * implements the server side of this cluster sends a query to the client on a predetermined
 * interval to see if the client would like to manage the poll period of the end device in
 * question. When the client side of the cluster hears from the server it has the opportunity to
 * respond with configuration data to either put the end device in a short poll mode or let the end
 * device continue to function normally.
 * <p>
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
