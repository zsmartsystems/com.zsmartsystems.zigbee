/**
 * Check In Command value object class.
 * <p>
 * Cluster: <b>Poll Control</b>. Command ID 0x00 is sent <b>FROM</b> the server.
 * This command is a <b>specific</b> command used for the Poll Control cluster.
 * <p>
 * The Poll Control Cluster server sends out a Check-in command to the devices to which it is
 * paired based on the serverâ€™s Check-inInterval attribute. It does this to find out if any of
 * the Poll Control Cluster Clients with which it is paired are interested in having it enter
 * fast poll mode so that it can be managed. This request is sent out based on either the
 * Check-inInterval, or the next Check-in value in the Fast Poll Stop Request generated by the
 * Poll Control Cluster Client. <br> The Check-in command expects a Check-in Response command
 * to be sent back from the Poll Control Client. If the Poll Control Server does not receive a
 * Check-in response back from the Poll Control Client up to 7.68 seconds it is free to return to
 * polling according to the LongPollInterval.
