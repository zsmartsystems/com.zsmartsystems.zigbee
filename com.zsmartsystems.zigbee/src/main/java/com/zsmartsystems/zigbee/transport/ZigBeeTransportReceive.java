/**
 * Defines the interface for data passed from the transport layer (ie dongle) to the ZigBee stack framework.
 * <p>
 * ZigBee transport interface implemented by different hardware drivers. This could support for example serial
 * interfaces for dongles, or IP connections to remote interfaces.
 * <p>
 * The ZCL interface allows the stack to specify the NWK (Network) header, the APS (Application Support Sublayer) and
 * the payload. The headers are provided separately to allow the framework to specify the configuration in some detail,
 * while allowing the transport implementation (eg dongle) to format the data as per its needs. The payload is
 * serialised by the framework using the {@link ZigBeeSerializer} and {@link ZigBeeDeserializer} interfaces, thus
 * allowing the format to be set for different hardware implementations.
 * <p>
 * The ZDO interface exchanges only command classes. This is different to the ZCL interface since different sticks tend
 * to implement ZDO functionality as individual commands rather than allowing a binary ZDO packet to be sent and
 * received.
