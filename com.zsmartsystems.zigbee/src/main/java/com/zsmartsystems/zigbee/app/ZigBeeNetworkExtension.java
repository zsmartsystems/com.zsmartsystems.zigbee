/**
 * Defines the interface for a ZigBee Extension.
 * <p>
 * Extensions provide specific functionality in the framework and can be instantiated and registered with the network
 * manager. An extension is registered with the {@link ZigBeeNetworkManager}, and the manager will take care of
 * starting and stopping the extension.
 * <p>
 * The extension lifecycle is as follows -:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #extensionInitialize} is called when the extension is first registered. This can be used to initialise any
 * internal variables, or register clusters etc with the system. The extension may not communicate on the network until
 * after the {@link #extensionStartup} method is called.
 * <li>{@link #extensionStartup} is called when the network is online and the extension may run operationally.
 * <li>{@link #extensionShutdown} is called when the extension is closed. The framework will do this when it is shutting
 * down.
 * </ul>
 * Extensions should not attempt to communicate on the network until after their {@link #extensionStartup} method has
 * been called, and must not communicate again after their {@link #extensionShutdown} method is called.
 * <p>
 * Extensions should register with the standard {@link ZigBeeNetworkManager} listeners to receive network notifications
 * -:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ZigBeeNetworkStateListener} for network state changes
 * <li>{@link ZigBeeNetworkNodeListener} for updates to nodes
 * <li>{@link ZigBeeCommandListener} to receive incoming commands
 * <li>{@link ZigBeeAnnounceListener} to receive announcement messages
 * </ul>
