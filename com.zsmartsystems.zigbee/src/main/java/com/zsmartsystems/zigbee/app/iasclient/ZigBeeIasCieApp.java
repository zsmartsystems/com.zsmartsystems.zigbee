/**
 * Implements the a minimal IAS client side functionality. The IAS (Intruder Alarm Systems) server clusters require
 * support on the client side when enroling. Once an IAS device joins the network, it looks for a CIE (Control and
 * Indicating Equipment) which is implemented here.
 * <p>
 * There are three methods for enrolling IAS Zone server to an IAS CIE (i.e., IAS Zone client):
 * <ul>
 * <li>Trip-to-pair
 * <li>Auto-Enroll-Response
 * <li>Auto-Enroll-Request
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * IAS Zone clients SHALL support either:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Trip-to-pair AND Auto-Enroll-Response, OR
 * <li>Auto-Enroll-Request
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An IAS Zone client MAY support all enrollment methods. The Trip-to-Pair enrollment method is primarily intended to be
 * used when there is a desire for an explicit enrollment method (e.g., when a GUI wizard or other commissioning tool is
 * used by a user or installer to add multiple IAS Zone servers in an orderly fashion, assign names to them, configure
 * them in the system).
 * <p>
 * >
 * The detailed requirements for each commissioning method follow:
 * <p>
 * Trip-to-Pair
 * <ol>
 * <li>After an IAS Zone server is commissioned to a network, the IAS CIEMAY perform service discovery.
 * <li>If the IAS CIEdetermines it wants to enroll the IAS Zone server, it SHALL send a Write Attribute command on the
 * IAS Zone server’s IAS_CIE_Addressattribute with its IEEE address
 * <li>The IAS Zone server MAY configure a binding table entry for the IAS CIE’s address because all of its
 * communication will be directed to the IAS CIE.
 * <li>Upon a user input determined by the manufacturer (e.g., a button, change to device’s ZoneStatus attribute that
 * would result in a Zone Status Change Notification command) and the IAS Zone server’s ZoneStateattribute equal to 0x00
 * (unenrolled), the IAS Zone server SHALL send a Zone Enroll Request command.
 * <li>The IAS CIESHALL send a Zone Enroll Response command, which assigns the IAS Zone server’s ZoneIDattribute.
 * <li>The IAS Zone server SHALL change its ZoneStateattribute to 0x01 (enrolled).
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Auto-Enroll-Response
 * <ol>
 * <li>After an IAS Zone server is commissioned to a network, the IAS CIEMAY perform service discovery.
 * <li>If the IAS CIEdetermines it wants to enroll the IAS Zone server, it SHALL send a Write Attribute command
 * on the IAS Zone server’s CIE_IAS_Addressattribute with its IEEE address.
 * <li>The IAS Zone server MAY configure a binding table entry for the IAS CIE’s address because all of its
 * communication will be directed to the IAS CIE.
 * <li>The IAS CIESHALL send a Zone Enroll Response, which assigns the IAS Zone server’s ZoneIDattribute.
 * <li>The IAS Zone server SHALL change its ZoneStateattribute to 0x01 (enrolled).
 * </ol>
