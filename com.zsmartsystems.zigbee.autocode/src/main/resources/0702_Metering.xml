    <description>The Metering Cluster provides a mechanism to retrieve usage information from Electric, Gas, Water, and potentially Thermal metering devices. These devices can operate on either battery or mains power, and can have a wide variety of sophistication. The Metering Cluster is designed to provide flexibility while limiting capabilities to a set number of metered information types. More advanced forms or data sets from metering devices will be supported in the Smart Energy Tunneling Cluster</description>
