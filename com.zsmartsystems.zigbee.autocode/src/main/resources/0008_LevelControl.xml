    <name>Level Control</name>
    <description>This cluster provides an interface for controlling a characteristic of a device that can be set to a level, for example the brightness of a light, the degree of closure of a door, or the power output of a heater.</description>
    <description>For many applications, a close relationship between this cluster and the OnOff cluster is needed. This section describes the dependencies that are required when an endpoint that implements the Level Control server cluster also implements the On/Off server cluster.</description>
    <description>The OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster and the CurrentLevel attribute of the Level Control cluster are intrinsically independent variables, as they are on different clusters. However, when both clusters are implemented on the same endpoint, dependencies MAY be introduced between them. Facilities are provided to introduce dependencies if required.</description>
    <description>There are two sets of commands provided in the Level Control cluster. These are identical, except that the first set (Move to Level, Move and Step) SHALL NOT affect the OnOff attribute, whereas the second set ('with On/Off' variants) SHALL.</description>
    <command code="0x00" source="client">
        <name>Move To Level Command</name>
        <description>On receipt of this command, a device SHALL move from its current level to the value given in the Level field. The meaning of &#8216;level&#8217; is device dependent &#8211;e.g., for a light it MAY mean brightness level.The movement SHALL be as continuous as technically practical, i.e., not a step function, and the time taken to move to the new level SHALL be equal to the value of the Transition time field, in tenths of a second, or as close to this as the device is able.If the Transition time field takes the value 0xffff then the time taken to move to the new level SHALL instead be determined by the OnOffTransitionTimeattribute. If OnOffTransitionTime, which is an optional attribute, is not present, the device SHALL move to its new level as fast as it is able.</description>
