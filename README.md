# Overview

This project aims to provide a ZigBee compatible framework written in Java and compatible with Android. It provides a ZigBee Cluster Library implementation, and network management functions, aiming to provide a full featured ZigBee framework that can be implemented within end systems. This repository aims to provide a high quality framework, with quality documentation and a thorough set of test cases to ensure against regression.

Packages are broken down to provide the main ZigBee framework, separate packages for dongles, and a console application that allows full use of the framework. The bundles include OSGi headers for use within an OSGi framework.

Minimum Android support is currently API19, Android 4.4 (KitKat). It is highly recommended to move to Android 8 as this may become the minimum requirement in the future to allow the framework to use the newer classes available from API26. Note that more modern language features are incorporated into the library and this may require Android users to use a modern version of Android Studio.

## Features

Features include -:

- ZigBee Cluster Library
- Over-The-Air firmware upgrade
- Device information data store

### ZigBee Cluster Library

The framework includes a ZigBee Cluster Library that is auto-generated from an XML definition file.

The following clusters are currently supported -:

| ID   | Cluster                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Once a group is established, frames, sent using the APSDE-DATA.request primitive and having a DstAddrMode of 0x01, denoting group addressing, will be delivered to every endpoint assigned to the group address named in the DstAddr parameter of the outgoing APSDE-DATA.request primitive on every device in the network for which there are such endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 0020 | POLL_CONTROL                            | This cluster provides a mechanism for the management of an end device’s MAC Data Request rate. For the purposes of this cluster, the term “poll” always refers to the sending of a MAC Data Request from the end device to the end device’s parent. This cluster can be used for instance by a configuration device to make an end device responsive for a certain period of time so that the device can be managed by the controller. This cluster is composed of a client and server. The end device implements the server side of this cluster. The server side contains several attributes related to the MAC Data Request rate for the device. The client side implements commands used to manage the poll rate for the device. The end device which implements the server side of this cluster sends a query to the client on a predetermined interval to see if the client would like to manage the poll period of the end device in question. When the client side of the cluster hears from the server it has the opportunity to respond with configuration data to either put the end device in a short poll mode or let the end device continue to function normally. |

| 0703 | MESSAGING                               | This cluster provides an interface for passing text messages between ZigBee devices. Messages are expected to be delivered via the ESI and then unicast to all individually registered devices implementing the Messaging Cluster on the ZigBee network, or just made available to all devices for later pickup. Nested and overlapping messages are not allowed. The current active message will be replaced if a new message is received by the ESI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 0704 | SMART_ENERGY_TUNNELING                  | The tunneling cluster provides an interface for tunneling protocols. It is comprised of commands and attributes required to transport any existing metering communication protocol within the payload of standard ZigBee frames (including the handling of issues such as addressing, fragmentation and flow control). Examples for such protocols are DLMS/COSEM, IEC61107, ANSI C12, M-Bus, ClimateTalk etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 0705 | PREPAYMENT                              | The Prepayment Cluster provides the facility to pass messages relating to the accounting functionality of a meter between devices on the HAN. It allows for the implementation of a system conforming to the set of standards relating to Payment Electricity Meters (IEC 62055) and also for the case where the accounting function is remote from the meter. Prepayment is used in situations where the supply of a service may be interrupted or enabled under the control of the meter or system in relation to a payment tariff. The accounting process may be within the meter or elsewhere in the system. The amount of available credit is decremented as the service is consumed and is incremented through payments made by the consumer. Such a system allows the consumer to better manage their energy consumption and reduces the risk of bad debt owing to the supplier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 0B04 | ELECTRICAL_MEASUREMENT                  | This cluster provides a mechanism for querying data about the electrical properties as measured by the device. This cluster may be implemented on any device type and be implemented on a per-endpoint basis. For example, a power strip device could represent each outlet on a different endpoint and report electrical information for each individual outlet. The only caveat is that if you implement an attribute that has an associated multiplier and divisor, then you must implement the associated multiplier and divisor attributes. For example if you implement DCVoltage, you must also implement DCVoltageMultiplier and DCVoltageDivisor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This information is useful to installers and other network administrators who wish to know how a particular device is functioning on the network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Packages

The framework implements a package structure that allows efficient use of re-usable components in a number of different applications.

| Package                                            | Description                                            |

## Testing

The framework incorporates a lot of unit testing, ensuring real data received from devices can be correctly decoded. When an error is detected following operation with real devices, a test case is normally added to reproduce the error and then it is fixed.

## Logging

A log viewer to decode the logs and present them in a usable format is available [here](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/openhab/zigbee-log-viewer). This provides filtering of data at different levels and filtering by node address.

## ZigBee Stack

The framework implements a ZigBee stack, currently employing a single endpoint. The default profile, device type and supported clusters can all be configured.

The supported clusters must be configured or the framework will not process any received frames. Likewise, the framework will not respond to messages sent to any endpoints other than endpoint 1.

To add support for local clusters, use the `ZigBeeNetworkManager` methods `addSupportedClientCluster` and `addSupportedServerCluster`. Note that any configuration required in the transport layer (dongle dependant) will also need to be configured consistently.

## Dongles

### Silicon Labs Ember EM35x / EFR32

The library supports the Silicon Labs EZSP (EmberZNet Serial Protocol) APIs for EM35x and EFR32 SoCs using ASH or SPI protocols over a serial interface. The implementation of the SPI protocol assumes that the SPI provides a TTY-like software interface to the application, or is otherwise abstracted via the `ZigBeePort` interface.

It is worth noting that EM3588 devices that have an embedded USB core will likely work with any baud rate, where dongles using external USB interface (eg CP2102 used with an EM3581) will likely require a specific baud rate.

Silabs did use to provide two main NCP images pre-build with firmware for EM35x, one image supported hardware flow control with a baud rate of 115200 and the other image supported software flow control with a rate of 57600.

Silicon Labs no longer provide pre-build firmware images, so now you have to build and compile firmware with their Simplicity Studio SDK for EmberZNet PRO Zigbee Protocol Stack Software. Simplicity Studio is a free download but building and compiling EmberZNet PRO Zigbee firmware images required that you have the serialnumber of an official Zigbee devkit registered to your Silicon Labs user account.

#### Ember NCP configuration

The library provide a standard set of configuration constants to configure the NCP for use as a coordinator. There are two methods available in the Ember driver to manipulate the configuration maps `updateDefaultConfiguration` and `updateDefaultPolicy`. The configuration is sent to the NCP during the initialisation sequence which is performed when calling the `ZigBeeNetworkManager.initialize()` method, so any changes to configuration must be performed prior to this.

The Ember dongle driver includes a public method `getEmberNcp()` which returns a `EmberNcp` class. This class provides high level methods for interacting directly with the NCP.

#### Ember Reset

By default the library uses the ASH Reset command to reset the NCP when the framework starts. Silabs have stated that this is not reliable due to possible communication problems between the NCP and the host. Where possible the user should implement a hardware reset to reset the NCP. Since this is application specific, the framework provides an interface for the application to implement this reset. The user should implement the `EmberNcpResetProvider` interface, and set this during NCP initialisation with the `ZigBeeDongleEzsp.setEmberNcpResetProvider()` method.

#### Ember MfgLib use

The library provides access to the `mfglib` functions in the NCP to facilitate device testing. To use this function, create the `ZigBeeDongleEzsp` and then call the `getEmberMfglib(EmberMfglibListener)` method to get the `EmberMfglib` class and also set the callback listener. The `EmberMfglib` class provides access to the `mfglib` functions.

Note that this can only be used if the dongle is not configured for use in the network (ie `initialize` has not been called).

The [com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.sniffer](https://github.com/zsmartsystems/com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.sniffer) project is an example of the use of these features to provide a network sniffer to route frames to [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

### Texas Instruments CC2531

The library supports the Texas Instruments ZNP protocol over a serial interface.

### Telegesis ETRX3

The library supports the Telegesis AT protocol over a serial interface. Currently implemented against R309C. Note that some dongles such as the Qivicon Funkstick may use PID/VID codes that require special drivers or they will not be detected as a serial port.

Under Linux you can add the Qivicon dongle without a custom made kernel with the following command -:

```
echo 10c4 89fb > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/cp210x/new_id
```

### ConBee / RaspBee

The library supports the Dresden Electronics RaspBee and ConBee dongles. Note that this requires some further work.

### XBee

The XBee S2C XStick is supported.

## Tested Hardware

The framework has been tested against many different devices - many lights, motion sensors, temperature/humidity/light sensors, plug sockets...

## ZigBee Dongles and Chipsets

The following table provides a summary of some of the dongles / chipsets that are available on the market and their support within the library. Receive sensitivity and transmit power are the main parameters affecting RF performance - it should be noted that regulations may reduce transmit power in some areas of the world and other factors can also impact performance.

- Receive: Defines the typical receive performance. A lower number is best.
- Transmit: Defines the maximum output power. A higher number is best.

## Device Data-Store

The framework implements a data store to serialise device information to and from disk to ensure network information is persisted across restarts. This is implemented via the `ZigBeeNetworkDataStore` interface, and the implementation of this interface is set in the `ZigBeeNetworkManager` with the `setNetworkDataStore(ZigBeeNetworkDataStore)` method.

While optional, it is highly recommended that this data store be implemented as it will greatly enhance performance across system restarts.

# Application Extensions

The framework includes optional functional applications to support higher layer functionality. Extensions implement the `ZigBeeNetworkExtension` interface and are registered with the network manager with the `ZigBeeNetworkManager.addExtension()` method. Extensions provide the top level network manager functionality and are normally augmented with lower level client/server functions associated with specific clusters. These client/server applications implement the `ZigBeeApplication` interface and are registered with the endpoint with the `ZigBeeEndpoint.addApplication()` method.

Currently implemented extensions include -:

- Discovery Extension (`ZigBeeDiscoveryExtension`)
- Network Mesh Monitor Extension (`ZigBeeDiscoveryExtension`)
- IAS CIE client (`ZigBeeIasCieExtension`)
- OTA Upgrade Server (`ZigBeeOtaUpgradeExtension`)
- Basic Cluster Server (`ZigBeeBasicServerExtension`)

These provide basic functionality and can be extended as required to meet the application needs.

It should be noted that extensions to the framework should be performed by linking to the `ZclCluster` through the `ZclCommandListener` notifications. This ensures that processing of `DefaultResponse` commands is handled correctly as the framework will automatically handle sending of these responses if there is no response sent. Calls to the `handleCommand` method must return `true` if the method has sent a response, or `false` if no response is sent to ensure that the framework correctly handles the `DefaultResponse` notifications. If all handlers return a `false` response, then the framework will send a `DefaultResponse` with `UNSUP_CLUSTER_COMMAND`, `UNSUP_GENERAL_COMMAND`, `UNSUP_MANUF_CLUSTER_COMMAND` or `UNSUP_MANUF_GENERAL_COMMAND`, as appropriate.

## Overview

Extensions may provide different levels of functionality - an extension may be as simple as configuring the framework to work with a specific feature, or could provide a detailed application.

An example of a simple extension is the `ZigBeeOtaUpgradeExtension` which simply listens for new devices on the network, and adds the `ZclOtaUpgradeServer` to the endpoint.

A more complex extension could for example handle the CIE IAS zones, providing a cross device implementation to coordinate the allocation of zones and handling of alarms.

The lifecycle of an extension is as follows -:

- `extensionInitialize` is called when the extension is first registered
- `extensionStartup` is called when the network is online and the extension may run operationally.
- `extensionShutdown` is called when the extension is closed. The framework will do this when it is shutting down.

Extensions should normally register as a `ZigBeeNetworkNodeListener` to get notified when a node is discovered or removed from the network so that they can add support to the node. The extension will then register a client or server application with the endpoint. The client/server application may register for callbacks with the endpoint (or node).

Extension may want to register a supported cluster with the `ZigBeeNetworkManager.addSupportedServerCluster()` and `ZigBeeNetworkManager.addSupportedClientCluster()` methods so that the services provided are discoverable.

Client/Server implementations will normally be linked to a specific cluster and provide the application logic for the cluster. The client/server implementation class should be named with the same name as the cluster, but exchanging `Cluster` for `Client` or `Server` (eg a server supporting the `ZclOtaUpgradeCluster` would be named `ZclOtaUpgradeServer`).

# Console Application

A console application is provided as part of the package. This application allows full use and testing of the framework. It can be used to test any new functionality without the added complexity of application level integration, or may be used as a stand-alone ZigBee configuration tool.

All commands implement the `ZigBeeConsoleCommand` interface, providing an easily extendible command system.

The command handlers used in the console application are in the package `com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.console`. This is separate from the main console application, and this allows the command handlers to be incorporated into other frameworks.

Command handlers for commands specific to each dongle implementation are in the package `com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.console.abc` (where abc is the name of the dongle). These commands allow access to non standard API relating solely to each dongle.

Command handlers take a set of arguments as provided by the user and will throw `IllegalArgumentException` if there are any errors with arguments, or `IllegalStateException` if there are any issues with the network state that prevent the command execution.

## Starting the Console

The console application takes the following parameters -:

| Option                       | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ----- |
| -?,--help                    | Print usage information                                  |
| -a,--pan <PAN ID>            | Set the ZigBee PAN ID                                    |
| -b,--baud <baud>             | Set the port baud rate                                   |
| -c,--channel <channel id>    | Set the ZigBee channel ID                                |
| -d,--dongle <dongle type>    | Set the dongle type to use (EMBER                        | CC2531   | TELEGESIS | CONBEE | XBEE) |
| -e,--epan <EPAN ID>          | Set the ZigBee EPAN ID                                   |
| -f,--flow <type>             | Set the flow control (NONE                               | HARDWARE | SOFTWARE) |
| -h,--profile <profile>       | Set the default profile ID                               |
| -l,--linkkey <key>           | Set the ZigBee Link key (defaults to well known ZHA key) |
| -n,--nwkkey <key>            | Set the ZigBee Network key (defaults to randon value)    |
| -o,--nwkkeyoutcnt <counter>  | Set the ZigBee Network key outgoing frame counter        |
| -p,--port <port name>        | Set the port                                             |
| -t,--linkkeyoutcnt <counter> | Set the ZigBee Link key outgoing frame counter           |
| -r,--reset                   | Reset the ZigBee dongle                                  |

The `-dongle` and `-port` options are always required. Most dongles will also require `-baud`, and may require `-flow`, although this may be hard coded for dongles that do not have this option.

If `-reset` is used, you should normally also set the `-channel`, `-pan`, `-epan` and `-nwkkey` options. If not set, defaults will be used to allow the system to start, however these may be random and may not allow you to use a network sniffer or other tools where some of this information may be required. The `-linkkey` may also be set, but will default to the well known ZHA `ZigBeeAlliance09` key if not set.

Decimal configuration values such as `pan` may be specified in decimal, or hexadecimal by prepending `0x` to the value (eg `0x2000`).

Example -:

```
-dongle EMBER -port /dev/tty.usbserial-FTD6C0AF -baud 115200 -flow software -channel 11 -pan 0x2000 -epan 987654321 -nwkkey AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -reset
```

## Console Commands

Where an address is required, endpoints can use the format `123/1` (destination/endpoint), or in hexadecimal (`0xed1/1`). Group addresses can be subsituted by preceding the address with a `#` - eg `#123` or `#0xed1`.

### General Commands
