# Overview

This project aims to provide a ZigBee Cluster Library written in Java. Packages are broken down to provide the main ZigBee framework, separate packages for dongles, and a test application.

# Packages

## ZigBee Stack

## Dongles
  
### Texas Instruments CC2531

The library supports the Texas Instruments ZNP protocol over a serial interface.

### Silicon Labs Ember EM35x

The library supports the Silicon Labs EZSP protocol using ASH over a serial interface.

## Tested Hardware
 
## ZigBee Dongles and Chipsets

The following table provides a summary of some of the dongles / chipsets that are available on the market nd their support within the library. Receive sensitivity and transmit power are the main parameters affecting RF performance - it should be noted that regulations may reduce transmit power in some areas of the world and other factors can also impact performance.

| ATSAMR21     | No         | -99dBm      | +4.0dBm      |          |
| JN5169       | No         | -96dBm      | +10.0dBm     |          |

* Receive: Defines the typical receive performance. A smaller number is best.
* Transmit: Defines the maximum output power. A larger number is best.
