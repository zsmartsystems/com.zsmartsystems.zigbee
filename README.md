# Overview

This project aims to provide a ZigBee compatible framework written in Java and compatible with Android. It provides a ZigBee Cluster Library implementation, and network management functions, aiming to provide a full featured ZigBee framework that can be implemented within end systems. This repository aims to provide a high quality framework, with quality documentation and a thorough set of test cases to ensure against regression.

Packages are broken down to provide the main ZigBee framework, separate packages for dongles, and a console application that allows full use of the framework. The bundles include OSGi headers for use within an OSGi framework.

Minimum Android support is currently API19, Android 4.4 (KitKat). It is highly recommended to move to Android 8 as this may become the minimum requirement in the future to allow the framework to use the newer classes available from API26.
 
## Features

Features include -:

* ZigBee Cluster Library
* Over-The-Air firmware upgrade

# Packages

The framework implements a package structure that allows efficient use of re-usable components in a number of different applications.

## Testing

The framework incorporates a lot of unit testing, ensuring real data received from devices can be correctly decoded. When an error is detected following operation with real devices, a test case is normally added to reproduce the error and then it is fixed. 

## Logging

A log viewer to decode the logs and present them in a usable format is available [here](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/openhab/zigbee-log-viewer). This provides filtering of data at different levels and filtering by node address.

## ZigBee Stack

## Dongles

### Silicon Labs Ember EM35x / EFR32

The library supports the Silicon Labs EZSP protocol using ASH or SPI protocols over a serial interface. The implementation of the SPI protocol assumes that the SPI provides a TTY-like software interface to the application, or is otherwise abstracted via the ```ZigBeePort``` interface.  

It is worth noting that EM3588 devices that have an embedded USB core will likely work with any baud rate, where dongles using external USB interface (eg CP2102 used with an EM3581) will likely require a specific baud rate.

Currently there are two main NCP images - one that supports hardware flow control with a baud rate of 115200, and one that supports software flow control with a rate of 57600.

#### Ember NCP configuration

The library provide a standard set of configuration constants to configure the NCP for use as a coordinator. There are two methods available in the Ember driver to manipulate the configuration maps ```updateDefaultConfiguration``` and ```updateDefaultPolicy```. The configuration is sent to the NCP during the initialisation sequence which is performed when calling the ```ZigBeeNetworkManager.initialize()``` method, so any changes to configuration must be performed prior to this.

The Ember dongle driver includes a public method ```getEmberNcp()``` which returns a ```EmberNcp``` class. This class provides high level methods for interacting directly with the NCP.

#### Ember MfgLib use

The library provides access to the ```mfglib``` functions in the NCP to facilitate device testing. To use this function, create the ```ZigBeeDongleEzsp``` and then call the ```getEmberMfglib(EmberMfglibListener)``` method to get the ```EmberMfglib``` class and also set the callback listener. The ```EmberMfglib``` class provides access to the ```mfglib``` functions.

Note that this can only be used if the dongle is not configured for use in the network (ie ```initialize``` has not been called).

The [com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.sniffer](https://github.com/zsmartsystems/com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.sniffer) project is an example of the use of these features to provide a network sniffer to route frames to [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

### Texas Instruments CC2531

The library supports the Texas Instruments ZNP protocol over a serial interface.

### Telegesis ETRX3

The library supports the Telegesis AT protocol over a serial interface. Currently implemented against R309C. Note that some dongles such as the Qivicon Funkstick may use PID/VID codes that require special drivers or they will not be detected as a serial port.

Under Linux you can add the Qivicon dongle without a custom made kernel with the following command -:

``` 
echo 10c4 89fb > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/cp210x/new_id
```

### ConBee / RaspBee

The library supports the Dresden Electronics RaspBee and ConBee dongles. Note that this requires some further work.

### XBee

The XBee S2C XStick is supported.

## Tested Hardware

The framework has been tested against many different devices - many lights, motion sensors, temperature/humidity/light sensors, plug sockets...

## ZigBee Dongles and Chipsets

The following table provides a summary of some of the dongles / chipsets that are available on the market and their support within the library. Receive sensitivity and transmit power are the main parameters affecting RF performance - it should be noted that regulations may reduce transmit power in some areas of the world and other factors can also impact performance.

* Receive: Defines the typical receive performance. A lower number is best.
* Transmit: Defines the maximum output power. A higher number is best.

# Application Extensions

The framework includes optional functional applications to support higher layer functionality. Extensions implement the ```ZigBeeNetworkExtension``` interface and are registered with the network manager with the ```ZigBeeNetworkManager.addExtension()``` method. Extensions provide the top level network manager functionality and are normally augmented with lower level client/server functions associated with specific clusters. These client/server applications implement the ```ZigBeeApplication``` interface and are registered with the endpoint with the ```ZigBeeEndpoint.addApplication()``` method.

Currently implemented extensions include -:

* Discovery Extension (```ZigBeeDiscoveryExtension```)
* Network Mesh Monitor Extension (```ZigBeeDiscoveryExtension```)
* IAS CIE client (```ZigBeeIasCieExtension```)
* OTA Upgrade Server (```ZigBeeOtaUpgradeExtension```)

These provide basic functionality and can be extended as required to meet the application needs.

## Overview

Extensions may provide different levels of functionality - an extension may be as simple as configuring the framework to work with a specific feature, or could provide a detailed application.

An example of a simple extension is the ```ZigBeeOtaUpgradeExtension``` which simply listens for new devices on the network, and adds the ```ZclOtaUpgradeServer``` to the endpoint.

A more complex extension could for example handle the CIE IAS zones, providing a cross device implementation to coordinate the allocation of zones and handling of alarms.

The lifecycle of an extension is as follows -:

* ```extensionInitialize``` is called when the extension is first registered
* ```extensionStartup``` is called when the network is online and the extension may run operationally.
* ```extensionShutdown``` is called when the extension is closed. The framework will do this when it is shutting down.

Extensions should normally register as a ```ZigBeeNetworkNodeListener``` to get notified when a node is discovered or removed from the network so that they can add support to the node. The extension will then register a client or server application with the endpoint. The client/server application may register for callbacks with the endpoint (or node).

Extension may want to register a supported cluster with the ```ZigBeeNetworkManager.addSupportedCluster()``` method so that the services provided are discoverable.

Client/Server implementations will normally be linked to a specific cluster and provide the application logic for the cluster. The client/server implementation class should be named with the same name as the cluster, but exchanging ```Cluster``` for ```Client``` or ```Server``` (eg a server supporting the ```ZclOtaUpgradeCluster``` would be named ```ZclOtaUpgradeServer```).

# Console Application

A console application is provided as part of the package. This application allows full use and testing of the framework. It can be used to test any new functionality without the added complexity of application level integration, or may be used as a stand-alone ZigBee configuration tool.

All commands implement the ```ZigBeeConsoleCommand``` interface, providing an easily extendible command system.

The command handlers used in the console application are in the package ```com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.console```. This is separate from the main console application, and this allows the command handlers to be incorporated into other frameworks.

Command handlers for commands specific to each dongle implementation are in the package ```com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.console.abc``` (where abc is the name of the dongle). These commands allow access to non standard API relating solely to each dongle.

Command handlers take a set of arguments as provided by the user and will throw ```IllegalArgumentException``` if there are any errors with arguments, or ```IllegalStateException``` if there are any issues with the network state that prevent the command execution.

## Starting the Console

The console application takes the following parameters -:

| Option                      | Description                                                               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|-?,--help                    | Print usage information                                                   |
|-a,--pan <PAN ID>            | Set the ZigBee PAN ID                                                     |
|-b,--baud <baud>             | Set the port baud rate                                                    |
|-c,--channel <channel id>    | Set the ZigBee channel ID                                                 |
|-d,--dongle <dongle type>    | Set the dongle type to use (EMBER | CC2531 | TELEGESIS | CONBEE | XBEE)   |
|-e,--epan <EPAN ID>          | Set the ZigBee EPAN ID                                                    |
|-f,--flow <type>             | Set the flow control (NONE | HARDWARE | SOFTWARE)                         |
|-l,--linkkey <key>           | Set the ZigBee Link key (defaults to well known ZHA key)                  |
|-n,--nwkkey <key>            | Set the ZigBee Network key (defaults to randon value)                     |
|-o,--nwkkeyoutcnt <counter>  | Set the ZigBee Network key outgoing frame counter                         |
|-p,--port <port name>        | Set the port                                                              |
|-t,--linkkeyoutcnt <counter> | Set the ZigBee Link key outgoing frame counter                            |
|-r,--reset                   | Reset the ZigBee dongle                                                   |

The ```-dongle``` and ```-port``` options are always required. Most dongles will also require ```-baud```, and may require ```-flow```, although this may be hard coded for dongles that do not have this option.

If ```-reset``` is used, you should normally also set the ```-channel```, ```-pan```, ```-epan``` and ```-nwkkey``` options.  If not set, defaults will be used to allow the system to start, however these may be random and may not allow you to use a network sniffer or other tools where some of this information may be required. The ```-linkkey``` may also be set, but will default to the well known ZHA ```ZigBeeAlliance09``` key if not set.

Decimal configuration values such as ```pan``` may be specified in decimal, or hexadecimal by prepending ```0x``` to the value (eg ```0x2000```).

Example -:

```
-dongle EMBER -port /dev/tty.usbserial-FTD6C0AF -baud 115200 -flow software -channel 11 -pan 0x2000 -epan 987654321 -nwkkey AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -reset
```

* Run the findBugs goal and check that you have not introduced any bugs into your code. FindBugs reports are generated with the ```mvn site``` goal, and reports are located in the ```target/site/findbugs.html``` file.
* Please consider raising issues before working on an enhancement to provide some coordination with other contributors.
* Keep PRs short - try and keep a single PR per enhancement. This makes tracking and reviewing easier.
* Contributions must be supported with tests. Ideally, you should aim to acheive full coverage of the code changes. Code coverage reports are located in the ```com.zsmartsystems.zigbee.test/target/site/jacoco-aggregate``` folder and opening the ```index.html``` file.
* Code must be formatted using the Eclipse code formatter provided in the project.
* Contributions must be your own and you must agree with the license.
* You must sign the PR and commits and must agree to the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/zsmartsystems/com.zsmartsystems.zigbee).
