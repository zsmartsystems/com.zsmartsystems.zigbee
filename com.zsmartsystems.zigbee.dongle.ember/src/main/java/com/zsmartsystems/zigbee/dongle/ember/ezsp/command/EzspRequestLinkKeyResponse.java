/**
 * Class to implement the Ember EZSP command <b>requestLinkKey</b>.
 * <p>
 * A function to request a Link Key from the Trust Center with another device on the Network
 * (which could be the Trust Center). A Link Key with the Trust Center is possible but the
 * requesting device cannot be the Trust Center. Link Keys are optional in ZigBee Standard
 * Security and thus the stack cannot know whether the other device supports them. If
 * EMBER_REQUEST_KEY_TIMEOUT is non-zero on the Trust Center and the partner device is not the
 * Trust Center, both devices must request keys with their partner device within the time
 * period. The Trust Center only supports one outstanding key request at a time and therefore
 * will ignore other requests. If the timeout is zero then the Trust Center will immediately
 * respond and not wait for the second request. The Trust Center will always immediately
 * respond to requests for a Link Key with it. Sleepy devices should poll at a higher rate until a
 * response is received or the request times out. The success or failure of the request is
 * returned via ezspZigbeeKeyEstablishmentHandler(...).
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing EZSP commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
