/**
 * Class to implement the Ember EZSP command <b>findAndRejoinNetwork</b>.
 * <p>
 * The application may call this function when contact with the network has been lost. The most
 * common usage case is when an end device can no longer communicate with its parent and wishes to
 * find a new one. Another case is when a device has missed a Network Key update and no longer has
 * the current Network Key. The stack will call ezspStackStatusHandler to indicate that the
 * network is down, then try to re-establish contact with the network by performing an active
 * scan, choosing a network with matching extended pan id, and sending a ZigBee network rejoin
 * request. A sec- ond call to the ezspStackStatusHandler callback indicates either the
 * success or the failure of the attempt. The process takes approximately 150 milliseconds per
 * channel to complete. This call replaces the emberMobileNodeHasMoved API from EmberZNet
 * 2.x, which used MAC association and consequently took half a second longer to complete.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing EZSP commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
