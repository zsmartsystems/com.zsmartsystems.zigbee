/**
 * Class to implement the Ember EZSP command <b>setAddressTableRemoteNodeId</b>.
 * <p>
 * Sets the short ID of an address table entry. Usually the application will not need to set the
 * short ID in the address table. Once the remote EUI64 is set the stack is capable of figuring out
 * the short ID on its own. However, in cases where the application does set the short ID, the
 * application must set the remote EUI64 prior to setting the short ID.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing EZSP commands.
