/**
 * Class to implement the Ember EZSP command <b>setExtendedTimeout</b>.
 * <p>
 * Tells the stack whether or not the normal interval between retransmissions of a retried
 * unicast message should be increased by EMBER_INDIRECT_TRANSMISSION_TIMEOUT. The
 * interval needs to be increased when sending to a sleepy node so that the message is not
 * retransmitted until the destination has had time to wake up and poll its parent. The stack
 * will automatically extend the timeout: - For our own sleepy children. - When an address
 * response is received from a parent on behalf of its child. - When an indirect transaction
 * expiry route error is received. - When an end device announcement is received from a sleepy
 * node.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing EZSP commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
