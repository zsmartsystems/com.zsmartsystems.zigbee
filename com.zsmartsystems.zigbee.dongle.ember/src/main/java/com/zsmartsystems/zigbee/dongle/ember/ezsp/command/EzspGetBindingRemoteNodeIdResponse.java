/**
 * Class to implement the Ember EZSP command <b>getBindingRemoteNodeId</b>.
 * <p>
 * Returns the node ID for the binding's destination, if the ID is known. If a message is sent
 * using the binding and the destination's ID is not known, the stack will discover the ID by
 * broadcasting a ZDO address request. The application can avoid the need for this discovery by
 * using setBindingRemoteNodeId when it knows the correct ID via some other means. The
 * destination's node ID is forgotten when the binding is changed, when the local node reboots
 * or, much more rarely, when the destination node changes its ID in response to an ID conflict.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing EZSP commands.
