 * Class to implement the Ember EZSP command <b>idConflictHandler</b>.

 * A callback invoked by the EmberZNet stack when an id conflict is discovered, that is, two
 * different nodes in the network were found to be using the same short id. The stack
 * automatically removes the conflicting short id from its internal tables (address,
 * binding, route, neighbor, and child tables). The application should discontinue any other
 * use of the id.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing EZSP commands.
